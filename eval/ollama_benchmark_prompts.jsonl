{"id":"extraction_schema","category":"structured_extraction","prompt":"Extract project intent, constraints, and open risks from this note and return strict JSON with keys goal, constraints, risks, assumptions: 'We need one PR at a time, benchmark local models under 16GB VRAM, keep runtime assistant lightweight during coding, and reserve heavier reasoning models for ingestion and planning windows.'"}
{"id":"retrieval_decision","category":"memory_retrieval","prompt":"Given candidate memories A='runtime profile should be low latency', B='ingestion can use higher reasoning profile', C='always maximize reasoning depth regardless workload', choose top 2 and explain why in 4 concise bullets."}
{"id":"code_reasoning","category":"implementation","prompt":"Write a Python function that computes p95 latency from a list of milliseconds and handles empty lists safely. Return only code."}
{"id":"tooling_tradeoff","category":"architecture","prompt":"Compare two local model routing policies for an IDE helper: Policy 1 always uses an 8B model, Policy 2 uses low-latency helper model for runtime and 8B only for ingestion. Provide recommendation with expected latency and VRAM tradeoffs."}
{"id":"bug_triage","category":"debugging","prompt":"A pipeline fails with ValueError when chunk_overlap >= chunk_size. Provide root cause, safe validation rule, and one test case in plain text."}
{"id":"security_scope","category":"security","prompt":"Identify two path-traversal risks in file ingestion systems and propose precise validation rules that prevent reading outside allowed roots."}
{"id":"compression_summary","category":"summarization","prompt":"Summarize the following status update into exactly 5 action items: 'PR hygiene is strict, profile routing is implemented, audit events exist, benchmark corpus still needs profile-aware gates, and we are adding local model matrix benchmarking now.'"}
{"id":"consistency_check","category":"consistency","prompt":"List three logical inconsistencies that can appear when roadmap docs are not updated after implementation, and provide one mitigation for each."}
