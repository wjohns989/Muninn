# Muninn Visual Identity Design Brief

## Brand Core

**Name:** Muninn (Old Norse: "Memory")  
**Tagline:** "The Persistent Memory MCP"  
**Mythology:** One of Odin's two ravens (Huginn = "Thought", Muninn = "Memory") who fly across the world gathering information

## Visual Identity

### Logo Concept

- **Primary Element:** Stylized Norse raven
- **Style:** Minimalist geometric with runic influences
- **Sacred Geometry:** Use angular, precise forms that evoke both:
  - Ancient Viking craftsmanship (shields, runestones, longship prows)
  - Modern tech precision (vector paths, clean edges)

### Runic Integration

- **Elder Futhark Runes:** Incorporate authentic runic scripts as decorative elements
- **Key Runes to Consider:**
  - ᛗ (Mannaz) - "Memory/Humanity"
  - ᚨ (Ansuz) - "Divine knowledge/Odin"
  - ᚱ (Raido) - "Journey/Movement" (data retrieval)
- **Usage:** Subtle integration in wings, background patterns, or as decorative borders

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**

- Midnight Blue: `#0B1426` (deep night sky)
- Raven Black: `#1A1A1D` (charcoal with blue undertone)
- Runic Silver: `#C0C5CE` (weathered steel)

**Accent Colors:**

- Ethereal Blue: `#4A6FA5` (northern lights)
- Ice White: `#E8EEF2` (for highlights only)

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Dark mode first (primary aesthetic)
- High contrast for accessibility
- Silver accents for emphasis (runes, eyes, key elements)

### Typography

**Recommended Fonts:**

- **Headers:** Norse-inspired geometric sans-serif (e.g., "Fjalla One", "Baloo 2")
- **Body:** Clean, modern monospace (e.g., "JetBrains Mono", "Fira Code")
- **Runic Display:** Authentic runic fonts for decorative elements only

### Design Principles

1. **Minimalism Over Complexity:** Every element must serve a purpose
2. **Geometric Precision:** Clean angles, perfect symmetry where appropriate
3. **Mystical Professionalism:** Ancient wisdom meets modern engineering
4. **Scalability:** Must work from 16px favicon to billboard size

### Asset Requirements

**Logo Variants:**

- Icon only (square, for favicons/avatars)
- Icon + Wordmark (horizontal for headers)
- Monochrome version (for light backgrounds)

**Repository Assets:**

- Banner: 1280x256px (GitHub repo header)
- Social preview: 1200x630px (Open Graph)
- Favicon: 32x32px, 16x16px

### Visual Mood

- **Keywords:** Ancient, Precise, Powerful, Mystical, Technical
- **Avoid:** Cartoonish, overly ornate, generic tech aesthetic
- **Inspiration:** Viking runestones, sacred geometry, Norse mythology, cyberpunk minimalism

## Implementation Notes

This design brief can be used with:

- AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
- Professional designers
- Design tools (Figma, Adobe Illustrator)

The goal is a visual identity that immediately communicates:

1. **Memory/Knowledge** (the raven, Odin's messenger)
2. **Ancient Reliability** (Norse mythology, thousands of years old)
3. **Modern Excellence** (clean geometry, professional execution)
