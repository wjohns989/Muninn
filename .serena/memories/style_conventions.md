# Style & Programming Conventions
- **Production-Grade Only**: No placeholders or stubs. Codes must be typed and robust.
- **Coding Style**: PEP8 compliance, strict typing, Google/NumPy docstrings.
- **Patterns**: Layered architecture (Routes -> Controllers -> Services -> Repositories).
- **Tool-First**: Leverage MCPs and research tools (context7, sequentialthinking).
- **Efficiency**: Batch edits, parallel execution where possible.
